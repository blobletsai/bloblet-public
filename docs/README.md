# Bloblet Documentation

Welcome to the Bloblet documentation repository.

## 📚 The Bloblet Bible

The core documentation has been consolidated into the **Bloblet Bible**. This is the single source of truth for all gameplay, economy, and technical details.

*   [**01 Gameplay**](./bible/01-gameplay/rules.md): How to play, Energize/Care, Luck Bucket, battle rules.
*   [**02 Economy**](./bible/02-economy/rules.md): Reward Points, pricing, treasury behavior, Sandbox vs Production.
*   [**03 Architecture**](./bible/03-architecture/configuration.md): High-level configuration and modes (player-facing).
*   [**04 Ops**](./bible/04-ops/): Internal runbooks and tools (not player-facing).
