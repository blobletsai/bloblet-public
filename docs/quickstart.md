Bloblet is a survival arena where you manage a digital creature, fight for Reward Points (RP), and optimize your gear. Here is your 30-second onboarding.

## The Survival Loop

</div>

1.  **Connect:** You need a wallet and Reward Points (RP).
2.  **Get RP:** You need RP to play.
    *   **Sandbox:** Use the **Faucet** (1,000 RP grant) or **Top-Up** (25–1,000 RP).
    *   **Production:** You will convert project tokens to RP.
3.  **Energize:** Visit the **Life Hub**. Spending RP to "Energize" wakes your bloblet, charges your boosters, and rolls for new gear.
4.  **Battle:** Use your boosters and gear to fight others. Winners steal RP and gear from losers.
5.  **Repeat:** Return to the Life Hub to heal, recharge boosters, and try for better items.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Energize (The Heartbeat)
*   **Cost:** 5 RP (net 4 RP with upkeep credit).
*   **Effect:** Grants **Boosters** (Temp Power) for 15 minutes.
    *   *Note: Boosters add temporary OP/DP (up to Level 3), while the Luck Bucket rolls for permanent Weapon/Shield upgrades.*
*   **Bonus:** Every Energize is a roll on the **Luck Bucket** for permanent gear upgrades.

### 2. Battle (The Risk)
*   **Stakes:** You risk your own RP in every fight.
*   **Loot:** Winning can steal your opponent's shield or weapon.
*   **Fairness:** Battles use a "Luck Variance" system. Better stats usually win, but upsets happen.

### 3. Economy (The Fuel)
*   **RP is Life:** If you run out of RP, you can't Energize or fight.
*   **Faucets:** In the Sandbox, use the Faucet to get your first 1000 RP.
