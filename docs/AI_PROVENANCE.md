# AI Provenance

This project is primarily built by AI agents (Codex + Claude), with human direction and review.

## What that means
- AI agents generate code, documentation, and refactors based on explicit tasks.
- Humans review, test, and approve changes before they ship.
- The public repo is curated to remove operational secrets and internal tooling.

## Quality & safety checks
- TypeScript type checks and linting
- Unit tests where applicable
- Local/CI builds before deploys

## Attribution
- **Codex**: automated coding tasks, refactors, and verification steps
- **Claude**: planning, documentation, and review assistance
