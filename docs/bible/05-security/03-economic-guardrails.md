## 1. Why Guardrails Exist

Bloblet is built around a shared treasury. If everyone could withdraw everything at once, the game would not survive long.

Economic guardrails exist to:
- Protect honest players from sudden collapses.
- Give the team time to react if something feels off.
- Keep the “play and earn” loop stable over months and years, not just days.

## 2. Personal Redeem Limits

When redeems are enabled, your ability to pull RP out of the game is constrained by:
- **Minimum redeem size:** Very small withdraws are blocked so the system does not get spammed with useless dust.
- **In-play floor:** Operators can require you to leave some RP behind so you remain part of the active arena.
- **Cooldown:** After redeeming, you must wait before redeeming again.
- **Daily cap:** In any 24-hour period, you can redeem only a slice of your balance.
- **Win-lock:** RP you just won in battle cannot be instantly cashed out; you must hold it for a while first.

The current default values for these rules are listed in the Economy chapter and mirrored in the Redeem flow UI.

## 3. Treasury-Level Safety Valves

In addition to per-player limits, we reserve the ability to:
- Temporarily slow down large outflows if something looks clearly abnormal.
- Pause or tighten certain flows (for example, high-value redeems) while an investigation is in progress.

These actions are meant to be rare and short-lived, and they exist to protect the shared pool, not to trap you forever.

## 4. Communication and Adjustments

If we need to make meaningful changes to guardrails:
- We will update this Bible and the in-game copy.
- For major changes, we will also communicate through public channels (for example, social media and patch notes).

The intent is simple: you should always understand the rules around your RP and the treasury, and you should never be surprised by hidden limits.
